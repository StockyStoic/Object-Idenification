# Object-Idenification
A suite of object identification metrics that I developed for comparing geological maps. Scikit-image tools were used.

The dynamic topography field of the Earth represents the uplift and subsidence patterns that are a result of convective stresses within the Earth's mantle.

For my PhD, I developed techniques for comparing any two dynamic topography maps and assessing their similarities. 

The benefit of my object identification approach is that one does not need an exact match between the two maps at all points and thus the double-penalty
problem is avoided.
